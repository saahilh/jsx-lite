# jsx-lite
A babel-based tool that will serve as a lightweight transpiler from jsx to html

After working on a web application using React for a few months, I came to really
appreciate the power that React, through jsx, has with regards to componentization and
separation of concerns. When I started work on a static website, I felt like I wanted
to try using jsx. However, I couldn't find any lightweight tools to use for this purpose,
and I felt like using the entirety of React and its large number of dependencies was overkill.
As such, I started working on this more lightweight transpiler. 

For now, I'll be using babel to handle the conversion from jsx to js.
I'll be focusing on implementing the transformation from js to HTML.
