# jsx-lite
A babel-based tool that will serve as a lightweight transpiler from jsx to html. This is for the terminal version of the transformation.

# Instructions
    * Clone local copy of repository
    * To setup `npm install`
    * To test, `npm run test`
    * To run transformation on the example in src/app.jsx, `npm run build`. This will create the output dist/bundle.js that will be loaded in by the templated index.html.
        * The root file to add jsx code is src/app.jsx.
        * The webpage produced can be seen by opening index.html in a browser.
